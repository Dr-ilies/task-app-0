# GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOW: CI (Continuous Integration)
# =================================================================================================
# WELCOME STUDENTS!
# This file defines a "Workflow" for GitHub Actions.
# Think of a workflow as a robotic automation script that runs whenever something happens in your repository.
#
# WHAT DOES THIS WORKFLOW DO?
# 1. It watches for changes (pushes) to the 'main' branch.
# 2. It figures out which parts of the app changed (Auth API, Tasks API, or Frontend).
# 3. It runs automated tests (pytest) BUT only for the parts that changed (saving time!).
# 4. It builds Docker images and pushes them to Google Cloud ONLY if tests pass.
#
# WHY DO WE NEED THIS?
# - "Continuous Integration" (CI) means merging code changes frequently.
# - This automation ensures we don't accidentally break the app.
# - It automatically packages our code so it's ready to deploy.
# =================================================================================================

# 'name' defines the name of the workflow as it appears in the "Actions" tab on GitHub.
# Try to give it a descriptive name like "Build and Test" or "Production Release".
name: CI

# 'on' defines the TRIGGERS. These are the events that wake up the robot.
on:
  # Trigger 1: 'push'
  # This runs whenever someone pushes code to the repository.
  push:
    # 'branches' filters the push event.
    # This workflow ONLY runs if the push is to the 'main' branch.
    # WHY? You might want extensive testing on 'main' but simpler checks on feature branches.
    # OTHER ATTRIBUTES: You can also use 'tags' or 'paths-ignore' here.
    branches:
      - main

  # Trigger 2: 'workflow_dispatch'
  # This allows you to MANUALLY trigger the workflow from the GitHub UI.
  # WHY? Useful for re-running a build if it failed due to a flakey network, or for debugging.
  workflow_dispatch:

# 'env' defines GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.
# These are like constants available to ALL jobs in this workflow.
# Access them using ${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}.
env:
  # GCP_PROJECT_ID is a secret stored in GitHub Settings > Secrets.
  # secrets are encrypted and safe to store. Never put passwords in plain text!
  PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}

  # The region where we want to push our Docker images.
  REGION: us-central1

  # The name of our repository in Google Artifact Registry.
  REPO_NAME: task-app-repo

# 'jobs' is a list of independent tasks that the workflow will execute.
# By default, jobs run significantly in PARALLEL (at the same time).
# If you need them to run one after another, you must use 'needs'.
jobs:
  # ===============================================================================================
  # JOB 1: Detect Changes
  # GOAL: Figure out which folders were modified in this commit.
  # WHY? If we only changed the Frontend, we shouldn't waste time testing the Backend.
  # ===============================================================================================
  changes:
    # 'runs-on' specifies the Operating System (Runner) to use.
    # 'ubuntu-latest' is the most common choice (Linux).
    # OTHER OPTIONS: 'windows-latest', 'macos-latest', or self-hosted runners.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # 'outputs' allows this job to pass data to FUTURE jobs.
    # Here, we expose the true/false results from the 'filter' step below.
    outputs:

      tasks-api: ${{ steps.filter.outputs.tasks-api }}
      frontend: ${{ steps.filter.outputs.frontend }}

    # 'steps' is the sequence of actions this job performs.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code.
      # This is a pre-made action 'actions/checkout' provided by GitHub.
      # It downloads your repository code onto the runner so we can analyze it.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Filter paths.
      # We use a community action 'dorny/paths-filter' to check file changes.
      # 'id: filter' gives this step a name so we can reference its outputs later (steps.filter.outputs...).
      - uses: dorny/paths-filter@v2

        with:
          # We define three filters.

  # ===============================================================================================
  # JOB 2: Run Tests (Conditional)
  # GOAL: Run unit tests (pytest) for the Python APIs.

    # This creates a dependency chain (Sequential execution).
