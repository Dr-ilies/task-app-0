# KUBERNETES MANIFEST: Namespace
# =================================================================================================
# WELCOME STUDENTS!
# This is where we start. A "Namespace" in Kubernetes is like a folder or a workspace.
# It allows you to group related resources together.
#
# WHY USE NAMESPACES?
# 1. Organization: Keep your "Task App" separate from your "Chat App".
# 2. Isolation: If you delete the namespace, EVERYTHING inside it is deleted.
# 3. Access Control: You can give team members access to only specific namespaces.
#
# ANALOGY:
# If the Kubernetes cluster is a "Hard Drive", a Namespace is a "Folder".
# =================================================================================================

# 'apiVersion' tells Kubernetes which version of the API schema we are using.
# 'v1' is the core, stable API version for basic things like Pods, Services, and Namespaces.
apiVersion: v1

# 'kind' specifies what type of object we are creating.
kind: Namespace

# 'metadata' contains data ABOUT the object, not the object itself.
metadata:
  # 'name' is the unique identifier for this namespace.
  # COMMAND: You will use this name later: 'kubectl get pods -n task-app'
  name: task-app

  # 'labels' are tags (key-value pairs) attached to the object.
  # USE CASE: You can filter objects by labels. e.g., 'kubectl get all -l name=task-app'
  labels:
    name: task-app
